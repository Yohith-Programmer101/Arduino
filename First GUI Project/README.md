# First GUI Project

- At first you have to install any webserver with apache in it. For example apache2, xamp, wamp.
- Then run the "First GUI Project.py" file and then open the "Webpage.py" in the localhost of the webserver and test it.
- You can even connect your pc to a wifi and control it using your android or ios device which is connected to the same wifi.
- To do that type "ip address show" in linux or "ipconfig" in windows or "ifconfig" in mac os and copy the ip address which mostly starts with "192.168." and paste it in the mobiles browser.
